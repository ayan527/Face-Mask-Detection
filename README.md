# Face-Mask-Detection
Face Mask Detection model is built up using Tensorflow, Keras, VGG19 as convolutional base, 1 hidden layer with 256 neurons & 1 output layer.
Around 10,000 images has been used to train the model, 800 images to tune the model, 992 unseen images to evaluate the accuracy of the model.
The model provided an accuracy around 96% on test images.
